XXXXXX  XXXXXX  born XXXXXX  [ˈmarja salɔˈmɛa skwɔˈdɔfska]; 7 XXXXXX – 4 XXXXXX was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a XXXXXX, the first person and only woman to win twice, the only person to win a XXXXXX in two different sciences, and was part of the XXXXXX family legacy of five XXXXXXs. She was also the first woman to become a professor at the XXXXXX and in XXXXXX became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon in XXXXXX.

She was born in XXXXXX, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at XXXXXX's clandestine XXXXXX and began her practical scientific training in XXXXXX. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her older sister Bronisława to study in XXXXXX, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. She shared the XXXXXX XXXXXX in Physics with her husband XXXXXX and with physicist XXXXXX She won the XXXXXX XXXXXX in Chemistry.

Her achievements included the development of the theory of radioactivity (a term that she coined[4][5][6]), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium. Under her direction, the world's first studies into the treatment of neoplasms were conducted using radioactive isotopes. She founded the XXXXXX Institutes in XXXXXX and in XXXXXX, which remain major centres of medical research today. During World War I, she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.

While a French citizen, XXXXXX  XXXXXX, who used both surnames,[7][8] never lost her sense of Polish identity. She taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland.[9] She named the first chemical element that she discovered‍—‌polonium, which she isolated in 1898‍—‌after her native country.[a]

XXXXXX died in 1934, aged 66, at a sanatorium in Sancellemoz (Haute-Savoie), France, of aplastic anemia from exposure to radiation in the course of her scientific research and in the course of her radiological work at field hospitals during World War I.[10]

XXXXXX  was born in XXXXXX, in the Russian partition of Poland, on 7 XXXXXX, the fifth and youngest child of well-known teachers Bronisława, née Boguska, and Władysław Skłodowski.[11] The elder siblings of XXXXXX (nicknamed Mania) were Zofia (born 1862, nicknamed Zosia), Józef (born 1863, nicknamed Józio), Bronisława (born 1865, nicknamed Bronia) and XXXXXX (born 1866, nicknamed Hela).

On both the paternal and maternal sides, the family had lost their property and fortunes through patriotic involvements in Polish national uprisings aimed at restoring Poland's independence (the most recent had been the XXXXXX Uprising of 1863–65).[14] This condemned the subsequent generation, including XXXXXX, her elder sisters and her brother, to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life.[14]

XXXXXX's paternal grandfather, Józef Skłodowski, had been a respected teacher in Lublin, where he taught the young Bolesław Prus,[15] who would become a leading figure in Polish literature.[16] Her father, Władysław Skłodowski, taught mathematics and physics, subjects that XXXXXX was to pursue, and was also director of two XXXXXX gymnasia for boys. After Russian authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from the Polish schools, he brought much of the laboratory equipment home, and instructed his children in its use.[12]

The father was eventually fired by his Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments, and forced to take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment, and eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the house.[12] XXXXXX's mother Bronisława operated a prestigious XXXXXX boarding school for girls; she resigned from the position after XXXXXX was born.[12] She died of tuberculosis in XXXXXX 1878, when XXXXXX was ten years old.[12] Less than three years earlier, XXXXXX's oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of typhus contracted from a boarder.[12] XXXXXX's father was an atheist; her mother a devout Catholic.[17] The deaths of XXXXXX's mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become agnostic.[18]

When she was ten years old, XXXXXX began attending the boarding school of J. Sikorska; next she attended a gymnasium for girls, from which she graduated on 12 XXXXXX with a gold medal.[11] After a collapse, possibly due to depression,[12] she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, and the next year with her father in XXXXXX, where she did some tutoring.[11] Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman, she and her sister Bronisława became involved with the clandestine XXXXXX (sometimes translated as Floating University), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.

XXXXXX made an agreement with her sister, Bronisława, that she would give her financial assistance during Bronisława's medical studies in XXXXXX, in exchange for similar assistance two years later.[11][19] In connection with this, XXXXXX took a position as governess: first as a home tutor in XXXXXX; then for two years as a governess in XXXXXX with a landed family, the Żorawskis, who were relatives of her father.[11][19] While working for the latter family, she fell in love with their son, XXXXXX Żorawski, a future eminent mathematician.[19] His parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative, and XXXXXX was unable to oppose them.[19] XXXXXX's loss of the relationship with Żorawski was tragic for both. He soon earned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician, becoming a professor and rector of Kraków University. Still, as an old man and a mathematics professor at the XXXXXX Polytechnic, he would sit contemplatively before the statue of XXXXXX  which had been erected in XXXXXX before the XXXXXX that she had founded in XXXXXX

At the beginning of 1890, Bronisława — who a few months earlier had married XXXXXX Dłuski, a Polish physician and social and political activist — invited XXXXXX to join them in XXXXXX. XXXXXX declined because she could not afford the university tuition; it would take her a year and a half longer to gather the necessary funds.[11] She was helped by her father, who was able to secure a more lucrative position again.[19] All that time she continued to educate herself, reading books, exchanging letters, and being tutored herself.[19] In early XXXXXX she returned home to her father in XXXXXX.[11] She continued working as a governess, and remained there till late 1891.[19] She tutored, studied at the XXXXXX, and began her practical scientific training (1890–91) in a chemical laboratory at the XXXXXX at Krakowskie Przedmieście 66, near XXXXXX's Old Town.[11][12][19] The laboratory was run by her cousin Józef Boguski, who had been an assistant in XXXXXX to the Russian chemist XXXXXX
