HMS St XXXXXX was the lead ship of her class of three dreadnought battleships built for the XXXXXX in the first decade of the 20th century. After commissioning in 1910, she spent her whole career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets, often serving as a flagship. Aside from participating in the Battle of XXXXXX in May 1916, during which she damaged a German battlecruiser, and the inconclusive Action of 19 August several months later, her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea. The ship was deemed obsolete after the war and was reduced to reserve and used as a training ship. St XXXXXX was sold for scrap in 1921 and broken up the following year.St XXXXXX, named after Admiral of the Fleet XXXXXX 1st Earl of St XXXXXX,[9] was ordered on 26 October 1907.[10] She was laid down at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth, on the same date, launched on 10 September 1908 and completed in May 1909.
